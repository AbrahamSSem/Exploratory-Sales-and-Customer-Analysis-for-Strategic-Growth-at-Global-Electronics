Exploratory analysis of the Global Electronics Company's data, offering insights into types of products sold, customer locations, seasonal trends and delivery time changes. 

## Project Objective and Overview
The objective is to explore key sales and customer data to identify potential growth areas, uncover seasonal patterns, assess delivery performance, and evaluate sales channel effectiveness, setting the foundation for targeted strategic investigations.

I have been provided with transactional and customer data for the Global Electronics Company, covering the period from January 2016 to December 2020. This dataset includes over 62,822 transaction records and contains detailed information about products, stores, and daily exchange rates.
The objective is to prepare, analyze, and visualize this data to identify key insights. These insights will inform strategic investigations and guide decision-making. 
The findings will focus on:
1. Understanding the types of products sold and the geographic distribution of customers.
2. Identifying seasonal patterns or trends in order volume and revenue.
3. Assessing the average delivery time and tracking any changes over time.
4. Comparing the average order value (AOV) between online and in-store sales.

# Key Insights
### 1. Types of Products sold and Customer Loctaion:
The company offers a diverse range of 8 product categories across 11 brands.
Customer base is predominantly located in North America, comprising 55% of the total, with a substantial proportion residing in the USA. Gender distribution among the customers is nearly balanced, with an almost equal split between male and female individuals.

### 2. Seasonal Sales Trends
Quarterly Revenue Trends: The report reveals clear seasonal patterns in revenue across the years. <u>*Q4 consistently shows strong revenue growth, peaking in December*</u>, likely due to holiday shopping and year-end promotions. In contrast, Q2 tends to experience a significant drop, particularly around April, suggesting a seasonal lull or lower consumer spending during this period. The recovery usually begins in Q3, though the strength of this recovery varies by year, with some years showing a more gradual increase while others remain relatively flat.

Yearly Revenue Trends: The line chart shows clear seasonal spikes in revenue, particularly in December and January, with noticeable drops around April and July. This suggests strong end-of-year and start-of-year sales, possibly driven by holiday shopping and New Year promotions.

Order Volume: The heatmap reveals a consistent increase in order volume during January and February across all years, peaking significantly in 2020. There is also a noticeable rise in volume during May and November, particularly in 2019, indicating potential seasonal campaigns or events during these months.

# Targeted Investigations
- Investigate Q2 Trends on a monthly level: Given the consistent dip in Q2, it would be worthwhile to analyze the factors contributing to this decline. Consider looking into external factors like weather given that we are working  or competitive actions during Q2.
