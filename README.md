**Low Impact on Revenue:** The missing products in these stores are not top earners **(bottom five)**, collectively accounting for less than **0.5%** of total revenue from **January 2022 to September 2023.**
**Optimization Opportunity:** The top-performing stores don't necessarily carry full inventory, indicating a need to optimize product mix rather than ensuring all products are stocked in every store.

### 4. Inventory Value and Turnover
Current Stock Levels: The total Stock on Hand (SOH) is <u>**29,742**</u> units across all locations, valued at <u>**$300,210.**</u>
Inventory Turnover Period (ITP): The ITP is <u>**13 days**</u>, meaning it would take just 13 days to sell through current inventory, signaling efficient inventory management.
Stock Cover (SC): The SC is <u>**17 days**<u/>, suggesting some discrepancies in stock levels across locations.

# Recommendations and Suggestions
- Focus on Electronics: Despite a decline in sales, Electronics remains a high-margin category. Investigating (sales team) and addressing the causes of this decline could improve overall profitability.
- Seasonal Marketing: Consider running campaigns (marketing team) during the June-September period to capitalize on summer and back-to-school events.
- Optimize Inventory Mix: Rather than stocking all products in every store, focus on optimizing the product mix based on local demand to enhance sales performance.
