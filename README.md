# Global-Electronics-Exploratory-Analysis-Report

Exploratory analysis of the Global Electronics Company's data, offering insights into types of products sold, customer locations, seasonal trends and delivery time changes. 

## Project Objective and Overview
The objective is to explore key sales and customer data to identify potential growth areas, uncover seasonal patterns, assess delivery performance, and evaluate sales channel effectiveness, setting the foundation for targeted strategic investigations.

## Overview
I have been provided with transactional and customer data for the Global Electronics Company, covering the period from January 2016 to December 2020. This dataset includes over 62,822 transaction records and contains detailed information about products, stores, and daily exchange rates.
The objective is to prepare, analyze, and visualize this data to identify key insights. These insights will inform strategic investigations and guide decision-making. 
The findings will focus on:
1. Understanding the types of products sold and the geographic distribution of customers.
2. Identifying seasonal patterns or trends in order volume and revenue.
3. Assessing the average delivery time and tracking any changes over time.
4. Comparing the average order value (AOV) between online and in-store sales.

## Key metrics
*Revenue:* Total sales accumulated across all years.
- Level of Detail: Analyzed by Product Category and broken down by time periods (Month, Quarter, and Year).
- Purpose: To understand overall sales performance and identify which product categories contribute the most to revenue.
  
*Seasonal Sales Index:* Measures how sales volume or revenue varies by season or time period.
- Level of Detail: Identified using time periods, focusing on monthly and quarterly data to detect recurring patterns.
- Purpose: To uncover seasonal trends and understand how sales fluctuate throughout the year.
  
*Average Delivery Time:* The average number of days taken to deliver orders to customers.
- Level of Detail: Calculated at the level of individual transactions and aggregated by time periods (Month, Quarter, and Year).
- Purpose: To assess delivery performance and identify any changes in delivery efficiency over time.
  
*Average Order Value (AOV):* The average value of each order placed.
- Level of Detail: Analyzed by Sales Channel (Online vs. In-Store) and product categories.
- Purpose: To determine if there is a significant difference in order values between online and in-store sales, which can inform pricing and sales strategies.

# Key Insights
### 1. Types of Products sold and Customer Loctaion
The company offers a diverse range of 8 product categories across 11 brands.
Customer base is predominantly located in North America, comprising 55% of the total, with a substantial proportion residing in the USA overall followed by UK. Gender distribution among the customers is nearly balanced, with an almost equal split between male and female individuals.

### 2. Seasonal Sales Trends
*Quarterly Revenue Trends:* The report reveals clear seasonal patterns in revenue across the years. <U>*Q4 consistently shows strong revenue growth, peaking in December*</U>, likely due to *holiday shopping and year-end promotions*. In contrast, Q2 tends to experience a significant drop, particularly around April, suggesting a seasonal lull or lower consumer spending during this period. The recovery usually begins in Q3, though the strength of this recovery varies by year, with some years showing a more gradual increase while others remain relatively flat.

*Yearly Revenue Trends:* The line chart shows a clear pattern in yearly revenue, with significant spikes in December and January, likely due to holiday shopping and New Year promotions, and noticeable drops around April and July.

In 2020, however, the trend was different: after a dip in April, revenue continued to decline until November before recovering in December. This unusual pattern is attributed to the impact of COVID-19.

For 2021, watching revenue patterns to see whether they return to pre-pandemic trends or if new patterns emerge due to ongoing changes in consumer behavior and market conditions is highly recommended.

*Order Volume:* The heatmap reveals a consistent increase in order volume during January and February across all years, peaking significantly in 2020. There is also a noticeable rise in volume during May and November, particularly in 2019, indicating potential seasonal campaigns or events during these months.

### 3.Delivery Time 
The average delivery time is 4.5 days, with a clear downward trend observed from 2016 to 2020, indicating a consistent improvement in delivery efficiency. While there are some fluctuations in monthly data within each year, the overall trend suggests that delivery processes have become faster and more streamlined. Additionally, the average delivery time remains steady when viewed at a quarterly level within each year, further reinforcing the gains in efficiency.Australia, in particular, had the best average delivery time of 3.8 days in 2020, though delivery times vary significantly between different locations.

### 4.Average Order Value Comparision
In-store purchases consistently have a higher average order value (AOV) than online transactions, except in 2016. The biggest difference was in 2017 of $132.61 across all countries. In-store sales also bring in more revenue and have more orders than online sales.

Notably, certain locations show significant differences in AOV between in-store and online purchases, suggesting localized factors at play. For instance, Australia has a striking AOV difference of $162.54, compared to $101.80 in North America and $68.88 in Europe, indicating that regional customer behavior may be influencing these trends.

# Take aways and Areas for Further Investigation.
- North America, especially the USA, is the company's primary market, indicating the need for targeted strategies to capitalize on this strong customer base.
  
- Given the consistent dip in Q2 across all years, it would be worthwhile to analyze the factors contributing to this decline. Consider looking into external factors like weather conditions, as North America, which is a key market, experiences the transition from winter to spring during this periodâ€”a time when outdoor activities and events are more common, possibly reducing the need for certain electronics products. Additionally, investigating competitive actions during Q2, such as promotions or new product launches by rivals, could provide insights into why sales drop during this quarter. Understanding these factors could help in developing strategies to mitigate the impact and boost sales during this period.
  
- Take Advantage of  Seasonal Patterns,The strong performance in Q4 across most years indicates that this period is crucial for revenue.Finding out the how different product categories brands perform during this time would be highly beneficial Capitalizing on this by planning targeted marketing campaigns, promotions, and product launches during Q4 could drive even higher sales.
  
- The consistent improvement in delivery times over the years shows that efforts to make operations more efficient have worked well. However, further refining the supply chain could lead to even faster deliveries and better customer satisfaction.Reviewing each step of the supply chain could help spot slowdowns that we saw in certain months.This might include checking how quickly orders are processed, how efficiently warehouses operate, and how fast deliveries reach customers, and by so doing ways to improve even futher can achieved.
Additionally analyzing location-specific factors and yearly trends could help identify areas where targeted improvements can be made, such as optimizing routes or adjusting resources based on regional performance.

- In-store shopping is driving more value and volume compared to online, highlighting the importance of physical retail locations for the company.Analyzing the demographic profiles of in-store versus online customers, including age, income level, and purchasing behavior could reveal preferences that drive higher in-store spending. Additionally examining the types of products being purchased in-store versus online because certain categories may have higher price points contributing to the higher AOV.
