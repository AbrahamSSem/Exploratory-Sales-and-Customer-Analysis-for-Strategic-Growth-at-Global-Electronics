1.Trasfered the unit price price from the product table to the sales table
Unit Price = RELATED(Products[Unit Price USD])

2.Given that we had Exchange rates that we different on different days, calculated sales column factoring in the Exchange rates(local curencies)
sales (USD) = 
VAR UnitsSold = Sales[Quantity]
VAR UnitPrice = Sales[Unit Price]
VAR ExchangeRate = 
    RELATED('Exchange_Rates'[Exchange])
RETURN
    IF(
        Sales[Currency Code] = "USD",
        UnitsSold * UnitPrice,
        UnitsSold * UnitPrice * ExchangeRate
    )

3.Total revenue in USD
total revenue = sumx(Sales,Sales[Quantity]*Sales[Unit Price])

4.Total sales accounting for the Exchange Rates.
total sales = SUM(Sales[sales (USD)])

5.Year to date Revenue for any selected year on the slicer.
YTD = VAR selectyear = MAX('calendar'[Year])
    VAR salesselectyear = [total revenue]
return 
    salesselectyear

6.Previous Year to date Revenue for any selected year on the slicer.
PYTD = VAR selectedyear = MAX('calendar'[Year])
        VAR salesPY = CALCULATE([total revenue],SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('calendar'[Date]))
    return
        salesPY

7.Difference btn YTD and PYTD for any selected year on the slicer.
YTD Vs PYTD = 
VAR SelectedYear = MAX('calendar'[Year])  
VAR TotalSalesSelectedYear = [total revenue]
VAR TotalSalesPY = 
    CALCULATE(
        [total revenue],
        SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('calendar'[Date])  
    )
RETURN
    TotalSalesSelectedYear - TotalSalesPY

8.Average Delivery Time
AOV = DIVIDE([total revenue],[Total Orders])
AOV online = CALCULATE(DIVIDE([total revenue],[Total Orders]),Stores[StoreKey] = 0)--filter on the store key 0 representing online
AOV stores = CALCULATE(DIVIDE([total revenue],[Total Orders]),Stores[StoreKey] <> 0)--filter on the store keys that are not 0
AOV Difference = [AOV online]-[AOV stores]

9.Delivery Times
DeliveryTime (DAYS) = DATEDIFF(Sales[Order Date],Sales[Delivery Date],DAY)--calculated column calcu;ating difference in days 
Avg Delivery Time = AVERAGE(Sales[DeliveryTime (DAYS)])
average DT Overtime = CALCULATE(AVERAGE(Sales[DeliveryTime (DAYS)]),ALLEXCEPT(Sales,'calendar'[Year],'calendar'[Month ]))--filetering only on time periods to see the trend.

10.Dynamic title
title = "Global Electronics Exploratory Analysis Report" &" " & SELECTEDVALUE('calendar'[Year],"All Years")
